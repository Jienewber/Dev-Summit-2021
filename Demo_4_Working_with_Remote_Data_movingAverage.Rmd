title: "Demo 4 | Working with Remote Data"
subtitle: "DevSummit 2021 | Harnessing the Power of R in ArcGIS with R-ArcGIS Bridge"
author: Jie Liu
output: html_notebook
abstract: |
  1. Use R-bridge to read remote data: COVID-19 (feature service) from JHU Dashboard
  2. Clean data: add time field, remove out of state and unassigned cases
  3. Analysis: calcualte 7-day average of new cases and new death
  4. Use R-bridge to write out feature class to Pro and create charts in Pro

########################################################################
# Reference: https://www.storybench.org/how-to-calculate-a-rolling-average-in-r/

# To calculate a simple moving average (over 7 days), we can use the rollmean() function from the zoo package. This function takes a k, which is an â€™integer width of the rolling window. 

library(zoo)
# The code below calculates a 3, 5, and 7-day rolling average for the deathsfrom COVID in the US.
COVID19_time <- COVID19_time %>%
    dplyr::arrange(desc(Countyname)) %>% 
    dplyr::group_by(Countyname) %>% 
    dplyr::mutate(NewCases_03da = zoo::rollmean(NewCases, k = 3, fill = NA),
                  NewCases_05da = zoo::rollmean(NewCases, k = 5, fill = NA),
                  NewCases_07da = zoo::rollmean(NewCases, k = 7, fill = NA)) %>% 
  dplyr::ungroup()

# Below is an example of this calculation for the county of Los Angeles
LA <- COVID19_time %>%

```{r}
# Behind the scene, each rolling mean is calculated from the numbers surrounding it. More specifically, the last non-NA value in the new NewCases_05da variable (4302), on date 2021-02-05, is the average NewCases in Los Angeles of that date with two data points on either side of it (i.e. the date 2021-02-05 has 2021-02-03 and 2021-02-04 preceding it, and 2021-02-06 and 2021-02-07 following it). We can check our math below.
